\caption{Specific activity of \Tl\ and \Bi\ in the most relevant materials and components used in the NEXT-100 detector \cite{Alvarez:2012as, Alvarez:2014kvs}. Three items (fused silica, sapphire and the field-cage resistors) have not been screened yet with sufficient precision; therefore, we use instead  measurements by the EXO Collaboration \cite{Leonard:2007uv, Auger:2012gs}. The activities determined via mass spectrometry (GDMS or ICPMS) or neutron activation analysis (NAA) were derived from Th and U concentrations. High-purity germanium (HPGe) $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy results correspond, whenever possible, to the lower parts of the natural decay chains. The figures in parentheses after the measurements give the 1-standard-deviation uncertainties in the last digits; the limits are given at 95\% CL. The abbreviations used to refer to the NEXT-100 detector subsystems have the following meaning: EP: energy plane; TP: tracking plane; FC: electric-field cage; PV: pressure vessel; IS: inner shielding; OS: outer shielding.} \label{tab:SpecificActivity}
